# Description
This is a cross platform library aimed towards the [Teensy series microcontrollers](https://www.pjrc.com/) to get the MAC address of them easily.

# Board Support
This library supports the following boards:
- Teensy 4.0
- Teensy 3.1
- Teensy 3.0


I don't have any of the other boards to test on so I cannot guarantee support for those. If someone would like to donate me one I'd be happy to add support here =D


# Notice a bug?
Open a GitHub issue! I developed this library for a work project so I'd like to actively maintain it
